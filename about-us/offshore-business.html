            <div class="offshore-content">
              <h3>Fixed Price</h3>
              <p>Nichi-In Software proposes customers with the Fixed Price Model when the scope of work and specifications of the project are reasonably clear and well defined. We work with the customers in defining the expected deliverables and timelines based on which the time and cost estimate is done.</p>
            </div>

          <!-- Time & Material -->

            <div class="offshore-content">
              <h3>Time & Material</h3>
              <p>The Time and Material model is advantageous to the customers when the scope of work and specifications of the project are either not clearly defined or when there is a possibility of significant changes down the line. The customers get greater flexibility to alter the project specifications on an ongoing basis at their discretion. The customer shall pay an hourly/monthly rate which is agreed at the time of signing of the contract. The customer may even revise the team size, thereby optimizing the cost and duration of the project.</p>

            <div class="offshore-content">
              <h3>Dedicated Development Center</h3>
              <p>In this model, Nichi-In Software forms teams with required team members, project managers/leaders, infrastructure and any necessary equipment based on the requirement of the customer. This model is a win- win model for both the customer and Nichi-In Sofware as the same team members working continuously for longer periods results in increased productivity over a period of time and the domain and technical knowledge is better retained. It gives stability and visibility to the team and the company in terms of work. This is the preferred model for any longer term contracts.</p>
