          We adopt methodologies flexibly based on the requirement of the project and the customerâ€™s reciprocation.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Agile Models (Scrum/XP)</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Though there are many agile models but in order to provide maximum benefits to customers, we particularly prefer Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP).
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            With Extreme Programming (XP), changes in a project can be smoothly incorporated in a cost-effective manner without disturbing the development process cycle.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            With Scrum, cross-functional teams develop software products in an iterative, incremental manner in cycles of work called Sprints. Each Sprint is incremented usable software. With completion of the Sprint, the final software is ready for customer demonstration.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Depending on the project needs, we also follow a hybrid model that incorporates the benefits of XP and Scrum methods to provide maximum gains associated with the project.

        <!-- Prototyping Model Section -->
        <div class="methodology-card bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Prototyping Model</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            In the prototyping model, an early approximation of the final product or system (termed as a prototype) is built, tested and delivered to customer for evaluation. Any suggestion made by the customer on improvements on the prototype is implemented and send to customer for re-evaluation. This process continues until an acceptable prototype is achieved from which the complete product or system is developed.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The model works best in the scenario when all requirements related to the project is obscure or not known in detail ahead of time.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Waterfall Model Section -->
        <div class="methodology-card bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8">
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Waterfall Model</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Waterfall model is a well-structured model. Here, development progresses steadily downwards, completing each phase in a sequential manner. The next phase of development starts on the achievement of defined goals of the previous phase.
